# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card Challenge

![Blog Card Preview.](design/preview.jpg "This is a screenshot of the Frontend Mentor Blog Preview Card")

This is my solution for the [Blog Preview Card Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS) on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

**Users should be able to:**

- View the blog preview card with responsive design.
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements.

## Built with:

- Semantic HTML.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox for layout.
- Mobile responsive design.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge of CSS organisation and media queries. One specific improvement was structuring my CSS better for grouping similar styles.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Improve accessibility by refining hover/focus states.
- Explore CSS Grid for better layout control.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Frontend Mentor for providing the challenge!
